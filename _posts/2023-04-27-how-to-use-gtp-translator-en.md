## Objective:
In the new AI era, it is more important than ever to break down the distance between people and eliminate language barriers. It is hoped that this new tool can provide more opportunities for communication with foreigners.

In addition to being used as a translation tool for traveling abroad, based on the experiences of netizens, it has helped older family members and foreign maids communicate smoothly, and some people even use it as a tool to chat with foreign partners' parents. As for me, I will help foreign travelers who are looking at maps near the MRT station, so that they can experience the enthusiasm of Taiwanese people!

We look forward to receiving more interesting usage scenarios from everyone!
